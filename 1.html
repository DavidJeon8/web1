  'You've got to find what you love, 스티븐 잡스'</a></strong></h3></u>
<p>Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick.
<br>Don't lose faith.
<br>I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did.
<br><strong>You've got to find what you love.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:-10px;">
<br>And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers.
<br>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life,
<br>and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.
<br>And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.
<br><br>(styJobs says....   Stanford Report, June 14, 2005)</p>
